                                Somaiya Vidyavihar is well renowned for its vast and lush green campus housing 34
                                institutions imparting academic excellence in fields as varied as medical, engineering,
                                commerce, Sanskrit, Buddhism et al. Somaiya qualifications have acquired a brand name
                                world over. For last 50 years the Somaiya educational group has created a glorious
                                record of providing Value Based Quality Education
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The College is one of the few young institutions of Somaiya Vidyavihar campus which
                                has, within a very short span established a prestigious name in the field of education.
                                The college made a modest beginning in the year 1995 with 300 students offering just
                                two educational streams. today it proudly boasts of educating more than 5500 students
                                every year and offering 15 diverse Under-Graduate, Post-Graduate courses. Inspired by
                                the vision of our founding father we endeavour to impart qualitative value based
                                education. Over the years we have strived to blend conventional education with
                                contemporary courses so as to equip our students with knowledge and skills required for
                                gainful employment. We offer, to our eligible students a basket of career oriented
                                courses to choose from, as per their likes and interests. The teaching learning process
                                at our institute imbibes a very glocal approach i.e. while using the traditional
                                personal touch method the faculty also uses the latest information communication
                                technology to make the learning process highly effective.

                                In the year 2000-01 a new chapter was added to our institution as we introduced the
                                science stream as we started the three year under graduate course in Computer Science.
                                In the year, 2001-02, the three year under graduate programme in Information Technology
                                was also introduced. In order to meet the demands of these courses the college has five
                                laboratories.
                            </p>

                                It was a proud moment for us when the college became a recognized institution for post
                                graduate programmes. We were one of the very few institutions in the University of
                                Mumbai to get an affiliation for conducting such programmes within seven years of its
                                inception. The post graduate programmes include M.Com. with specialization offered in
                                Finance and Management started in the year 2002-03. This was followed by the
                                introduction of M.Sc. (Computer Science) and M.Sc. (Information Technology) the same
                                year. Every year the number of students enrolling for these programmes has been
                                steadily increasing.

                                In the year 2010-11, we also started M.Com. in Banking and Finance and in 2011-12
                                started Masters in Communication and Journalism. The College is also a Research Centre
